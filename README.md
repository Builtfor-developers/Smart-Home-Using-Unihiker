# Smart-Home-Using-Unihiker
This project is based on Python and Arduino code for Unihiker. In this project, I have used the new Unihiker Single Board Computer (SBC) to create a smart home setup. Imagine controlling lights and monitoring room temperature with just a few clicks - that's the essence of this project.
Using Unihiker as brains, I have connected three buttons to control three LEDs via Nodemcu using MQTT - a nifty communication protocol. Plus, I have tossed in a DHT11 sensor to keep tabs on the room temperature.
This project serves as a beginner-friendly gateway to the home automation. With straightforward steps and minimal components.
## Used Components
* Unihiker
* Nodemcu
* LEDs (3)
* DHT11 Sensor
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* A 3v Cell
* A laptop
* VScode(Optional)
